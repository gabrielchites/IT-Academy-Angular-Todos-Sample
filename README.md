# IT-Academy-Angular-Todos-Sample
Simple TODOs app made in Angular for Microsoft/Dell IT Academy lessons.

## API Server
A very simple backend is provided on the Solutions/server folder. 
Enter the server folder and simply run `npm start` that the API will run on port 3000.

In the project root you can find `Insomnia_Workspace.json`, an [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) file for testing the API RESTful operations.

## Angular App
Go to Solutions/client folder and run either `npm start` or `ng serve` for a dev server. The app will run on `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
